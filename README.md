# IPAS-COSMOSTELLAR
# Project Title: Mars Aerial Drone for Exploration and Analysis

## Project Overview:
The project aims to design a fully functional drone capable of operating on Mars for the International Planetary Aerial System Competition. The drone should have a flight duration of 10 minutes on Mars and the ability to lift a payload of 100 grams. It will be controlled from a base station on Mars and possess autonomous capabilities. The drone will operate within a 5 km radius from the base station and traverse varying Martian terrains of different altitudes.

## Key Requirements:
- Flight duration: The drone should sustain a continuous mission time of 10 minutes per flight.
- Payload capacity: The drone should be capable of lifting a payload of 100 grams.
- Weather conditions: While primarily operating during clear weather conditions, the drone should withstand temperature extremes and be able to function in any weather condition on Mars.
- Vision capabilities: The drone should have 360-degree vision capabilities to observe its surroundings during flight.
- Sensors and cameras: The drone should be equipped with cameras and sensors to gather data and transmit it back to the base station for further analysis.
- Modularity and serviceability: The drone should be designed with modularity and ease of serviceability in mind, enabling astronauts to carry out repairs when needed.

## Additional Considerations:
- Control: The drone should be controllable from the base station on Mars, providing real-time feedback and control.
- Autonomous capabilities: The drone should possess autonomous features, allowing it to navigate Martian terrains and avoid obstacles.
- Range and radius: The drone should operate within a 5 km radius from the base station.
- Power generation: The drone should have sufficient power or generate capabilities to sustain its missions and flight duration.

The Mars aerial drone will contribute to the exploration and analysis of the Martian environment by providing visual data, collecting scientific samples, and supporting various research activities. Its design will prioritize durability, functionality, and ease of maintenance to facilitate repairs by astronauts.
